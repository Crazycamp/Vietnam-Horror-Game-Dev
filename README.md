# Tan Trường
First draft:

Main character from the city.
Section (walking in her room and explore her home, UI, inventory)
Lost parents due to house fire collapse on them.
Section where we were chased because fire are near
She survived (could be the player has to go and take out the trash after dinner so she survived) but suffered from losing her love ones.

A distance relatives adopted her so she moved to a different city .
Scene with players standing and hearing over the uncle and aunty conversation about her new life


She was not very welcome.
The man figure is running for town leader (something with our Vietnamese democratic systems) so adopting her helped him with his publicity.
The woman figure was jelous of her sister so the main character was also hated.
She allowed to come school like any ordanary students.

First day at school, being from another place, she was not very welcomed by the classmates nor teacher.
Only one person sit next to her became her close friend.
After a month or so they hang out, have fun and stuff, and bond greatly
Main Character invited her BFF back home and play.
Details and stuff, her friend saw something, they both ignored.
Her friend after their one time spending at her house disappeared.

She asked around for details but no one has any clue.
She then has to find clues to find her missing friend. It starts at her school
